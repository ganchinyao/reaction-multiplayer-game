    <string name="faq_qn1">Is this game available on iOS?</string>
    <string name="faq_qn1_desc">This game is currently only available on Android. We have no plan for an iOS release yet.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn2">How long do I have access to the Remove Ads and Insane Mode features if I were to purchase them?</string>
    <string name="faq_qn2_desc">You will have a lifetime access. As the purchase transaction is handled by Google, the purchase is tied to your Google Play account.
            As long as you use the same Google account, you can click on \"Restore your Purchase\" in the Shop page, and have your previous purchase restored.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn3">I have purchased the Remove Ads or Insane Mode feature, but it was not reflected.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn3_desc">This can happen if you delete the game and reinstall it, or install it on another device. It may also happen if you manually clear this app\'s data
            from your phone\'s application setting page. In any case, you can always click on \"Restore your purchase\" and have your previous purchase restored, as long as
            you are using the same Google account. If this does not work, try to reinstall the app and click on \"Restore your purchase\" again.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn4">Is this game available in other languages?</string>
    <string name="faq_qn4_desc">This game is currently only available in English. However, we do have plans to localize the game to other languages.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn5">Can I increase or decrease the font size in this game?</string>
    <string name="faq_qn5_desc">You are not able to increase or decrease the font size directly from the game. However, you can go to your default phone\'s settings page, and
        increase or decrease the font size there. The font size in this game will then be reflected accordingly.</string>
    <string name="faq_qn6">Can I choose what Game Mode to play in Quick Play?</string>
    <string name="faq_qn6_desc">For each round, Quick Play randomly choose a Game Mode from all the available Game Modes. You can however choose which Game Mode to play
            in Custom Game.</string>

    <string name="parentsguide_text2">How can I manage or turn off In-app-purchase?</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text3">This game is free to download and play, but contains two In-app-purchases:\n\n\t\t-Remove Ads\n\t\t-Unlock Insane Mode\n\nThese
        purchases are never required to play the game, but can be used to enhance the gameplay. In-app-purchase are paid for with real money, and are always
        labeled as such. You can easily manage the ability to make in-app-purchase, adjust password protection settings, or disable in-app-purchase entirely. To do so,
        open Google Playstore on your device, and go to \'User controls\' section in the Playstore Settings page. This can prevent your child from making unintentional in-app-purchase.</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text4">Who processes the In-app-purchase transactions?</string>
    <string name="parentsguide_text5">We do not handle the In-app-purchase transactions. The payment transactions themselves are completed through Google Play via
        your personal email address associated with that account. Receipts for these transactions are emailed to you by Google.\n\nTherefore, we do not have
        access to any of your personal and credit card information, as the transaction are completed through Google Play.</string>

    <string name="developersletter_text1">\nDear React! users\n\nGreetings! It is an honor for us to talk to
        you through this letter. We would like to share more insights with you and everything you need to know about
        this app.\n\nThis app was conceived and developed by a few of us from ground up. We have wanted a game that offers a multi-player experience so that we can play with our friends, for giggles.
        At the same time, the game should also possess beautiful graphics and sound effects for maximum satisfaction. We also wanted a game whereby only 1 device is necessary to play with all our
        friends locally, without the need for wi-fi or bluetooth connection. As we searched the available multi-player game titles on Playstore, we realized that there are little
        selections available which meet our criteria. Therefore,
        we decided to create one ourselves, and make it available to everyone globally. To ensure that users are not able to memorize the quiz of
        our games and hence having an advantage over their friends, the majority of our Game Modes utilize randomness. This ensures
        that every possible combinations and permutations are pulled off. Therefore, no players would have a huge advantage by playing this game for a longer time. This makes the game more
        fair, and in return, more fun. \n\nAs a small team, we are responsible for tackling all the necessary aspects of an app such as code, design, and sounds. In doing so,
        we created some original content in our studio itself. At the same time, we also utilized beautiful free-for-commercial-use images and sounds that were found online, honoring
        all their attribution requirements. These attributions can be found inside the \'Credits\' page of this app.\nFor
        some images and sounds, we acquired the necessary licenses to use them in our app without having to attribute back to the original authors. We take copyright infringement seriously,
        and in no part of this app do we use resources that infringe upon the rights of their respective holders.\n\nAs we code this app up from scratch, we also utilize several
        free-to-use libraries from other developers. We would like to take this opportunity to give them a shout out for their wonderful works, which helped to shorten the development time frame
        for many developers out there.\n\nAs you start to use this app, you might come across errors which forced this app to shut down. Such errors are often unprecedented and we deeply
        apologized for the inconvenience. We strive to make your experience as pleasant as possible. While we did heavy testing for the app before launching, the heavy fragmentation of Android devices
        means that it is not feasible for us to test out on every single available Android devices in the market. Hence, some errors might be only native to certain devices and we had not
        experienced it during our testing phase. However, we assure you that the crash reports that you sent to us will be analyzed in detail and we will fix these potential crashes in subsequent
        updates.\n\nThe next thing that we would like to talk about is advertisements and in-app-purchase. While we strive to make this app available freely to all our users, advertisements
        are an essential reason we are able to do so. We have put advertisements only at 3 places, namely the home page, the \'Return to main menu\' pop up, and one full screen ads at the victory
        page. We aimed to put ads in such a way that it is non-infringing on your game play, and allow our users to have a pleasant experience playing our game. It is important for us to ensure that
        Ads are only delivered in the most appropriate and engaging way. We understand that some of you may prefer to use the app without Ads. Hence, we have added a feature
        that allows you to make a one-time purchase which removes the Ads entirely from this app. As the in-app-purchase transaction is handled by Google, which in turn is tied to your Google Account,
        you are able to enjoy the feature for a lifetime with a single purchase, so long as you used the same Google Account. The \'Insane Mode\' offers a more challenging Game Play,
        featuring a higher level of difficulty. This mode is particularly targeted at users who want a faster-paced game play, delving into more challenging situations. It is not available
        for free, and require a one time purchase. We hope that for users who do not wish to spend their hard-earned money on this app, the Easy, Medium, and Hard modes can offer you
        sufficient joys and satisfaction.\n\nLastly, we would like to thank You, our users, who had downloaded this app and supported us along the way. We hope you have a fun time playing with your friends.
        If you like our app, do remember to give us a Rate in the Playstore, and recommend it to more of your friends! We thank you for your time in reading this letter! Have fun, and giggle on! :)
        \n\nFrom your friendly developers at Ninebit Studio</string>

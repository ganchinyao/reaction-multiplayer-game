# Installation

This app will no longer be maintained. Since the source code is more than 6 years old, it probably requires lots of changes to gradle and the build files before you can build it. Many android APIs may no longer work if built with newer version of Android.

All secret keys have been modified with `SAMPLE_TO_REPLACE`. Replace them with your own.
